## Coursera Regression Models

Johns Hopkins University
Bloomberg School of Public Health

About the Course
Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions.  Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientistâ€™s toolkit. This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.

The primary instructor of this class is Brian Caffo. Brian is a professor at Johns Hopkins Biostatistics and co-directs the SMART working group. This class is co-taught by Roger Peng and Jeff Leek. In addition, Sean Kross and Nick Carchedi have been helping greatly.
